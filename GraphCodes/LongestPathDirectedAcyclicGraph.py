class Graph:
    """
     Given a Weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and a source vertex s in it, find the longest distances from s to all
     other vertices in the given graph.The longest path problem for a general graph is not as easy as the shortest path
     problem because the longest path problem doesnâ€™t have optimal substructure property. In fact, the Longest Path
     problem is NP-Hard for a general graph.However, the longest path problem has a linear time solution for directed
     acyclic graphs.The idea is similar to linear time solution for shortest path in a directed acyclic graph.,
     we use Topological Sorting.
