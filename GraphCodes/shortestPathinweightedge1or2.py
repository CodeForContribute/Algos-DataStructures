        Expected time complexity is O(V+E).
        A Simple Solution is to use Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm,
        we can get a shortest path in O(E + VLogV) time.
        How to do it in O(V+E) time?
        The idea is to use BFS.
          One important observation about BFS is, the path used in BFS always has least number of edges between
          any two vertices. So if all edges are of same weight, we can use BFS to find the shortest path.
          For this problem, we can modify the graph and split all edges of weight 2 into two edges of weight 1 each.
          In the modified graph, we can use BFS to find the shortest path.
        How many new intermediate vertices are needed?
          We need to add a new intermediate vertex for every source
          vertex. The reason is simple, if we add a intermediate vertex x between u and v and if we add same vertex
          between y and z, then new paths u to z and y to v are added to graph which might have note been
          there in original graph. Therefore in a graph with V vertices, we need V extra vertices.
